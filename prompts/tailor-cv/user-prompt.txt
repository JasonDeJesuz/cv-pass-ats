I have a CV, a job description, and a document with ATS (Applicant Tracking System) optimization strategies. 
I want you to tailor my CV to better match the job description while following the ATS optimization guidelines.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS - FOLLOW THESE EXACTLY:
1. DO NOT INVENT OR FABRICATE ANY INFORMATION. This is absolutely critical.
2. DO NOT add any skills, experiences, or qualifications that are not explicitly mentioned in my original CV.
3. DO NOT change my job titles, roles, or claim expertise in areas not mentioned in my original CV.
4. You may ONLY:
   - Reorganize existing information to highlight relevant experience
   - Rephrase existing achievements to better match job description keywords
   - Adjust the summary to emphasize relevant skills I already have
   - Prioritize skills that match the job description (but only from my existing skill set)
5. The summary should be based ONLY on information present in my original CV.
6. Maintain the same YAML structure as my original CV.
7. If the job requires skills I don't have, DO NOT add them - focus on transferable skills instead.

My current CV:
{{CV_CONTENT}}

Job Description:
{{JOB_DESCRIPTION}}

ATS Optimization Strategies:
{{ATS_STRATEGY}}

Please return only the tailored CV in YAML format, with no additional explanations.
