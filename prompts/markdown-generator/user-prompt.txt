I need to convert a YAML CV into a professional Markdown format that is optimized for ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems).

The YAML CV content is:
{{YAML_CONTENT}}

The job description this CV is tailored for is:
{{JOB_DESCRIPTION}}

Please follow these ATS optimization guidelines:
{{ATS_STRATEGY}}

Please create a professional, clean, and ATS-optimized Markdown CV based on this YAML data. 
The Markdown should:
1. Be well-structured and easy to read
2. Use appropriate headers, bullet points, and formatting
3. Highlight the most relevant skills and experiences for the job description
4. Follow ATS best practices to ensure it passes automated screening
5. Be ready to convert to a Word document
6. Cannot contain bullet lists due to formatting issues, especially inside an experience.

Return only the Markdown content with no additional explanations.
